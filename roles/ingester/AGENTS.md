# WITHIN-envelope toggles ONLY. Forbidden keys (allowed_skills, allowed_mcps,
# allowed_actions, max_skill_risk_level, purpose, persona, policy_enabled,
# category_b_overrides) are rejected loudly by the overlay validator — set
# those in role.yaml, not here.

# ingester — operational notes

I am the domain-agnostic data gateway: normalise raw signals, flag ambiguity (confidence < 0.6), and ALERT_ESCALATE unrecognised formats rather than dropping data. "Done" = clean, typed signal downstream.

This overlay is operator/project preference, **subordinate to the role's signed
`role.yaml`**. Use it to record deployment-specific context and to toggle
already-allowed capabilities — not to grant new ones.
